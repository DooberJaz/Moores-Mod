BUG/ISSUE REPORT----------------
NOTE: Fixed bugs will remain for now so I can see progress

Blustone doesnt power redstone on sides (it seems to have a facing direction that it can connect to, but multiple
connections seem to ruin it (sometimes stopping output alltogether)
BluLogic does nothing (fixed)
Blulogic blocks cannot be broken, possible tileentity issue
All textures need setting up
Tileentity NBT is not functional (data is lost upon reloading world)
Generally blustone is very very buggy, but only with redstone and not with itself. May be unfixable due to redstones code
Possibly could inherit from redstone somehow to fix it (fixed with a workaround, blustone now has a facing direction)

Tileentity persistence may be kept now?

Cannot get property power even though it exists - had this before and fixed so can fix again

Blustone notifyofstatechange is broken, possibly due to power property being needed, honestly this may be a larger issue
The logic blocks always struggles with updating properly, so this function may have issues communicating with all blocks
check the function(s) to see?
