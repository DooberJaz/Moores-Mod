BUG/ISSUE REPORT----------------
NOTE: Fixed bugs will remain for now so I can see progress

Blustone doesnt power redstone on sides (it seems to have a facing direction that it can connect to, but multiple
connections seem to ruin it (sometimes stopping output alltogether)
BluLogic does nothing (fixed)
Blulogic blocks cannot be broken, possible tileentity issue
All textures need setting up
Tileentity NBT is not functional (data is lost upon reloading world)
Generally blustone is very very buggy, but only with redstone and not with itself. May be unfixable due to redstones code
Possibly could inherit from redstone somehow to fix it
